# Breast-Cancer-Data-Exploration-Using-PCA

The Breast Cancer data set is a real-valued multivariate data that consists of two classes, where each class signifies whether a patient has breast cancer or not. The two categories are: malignant and benign.

The malignant class has 212 samples, whereas the benign class has 357 samples.

It has 30 features shared across all classes: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, fractal dimension, etc.

You can download the breast cancer dataset from here, or rather an easy way is by loading it with the help of the sklearn library.
